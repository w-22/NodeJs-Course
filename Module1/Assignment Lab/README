Here you can find the files I subbmitted to the course NodeJs

First of all I want to say that I use csvtojson library
since I like to focus on studing NodeJs technology and less on Computer-Science kind of exercises

Design:
There is 1 function which is responsible for the parsing bussiness logic
It waits for the following events:
1. 'csv' event so it can count the number of rows parsed (so we will see it is 1000 rows as excpected)
2. 'error' event to print any error while parsing
3. 'done' event to write some finish message to the user
4. 'end_parsed' event to finally get the json created and write down to a file

I also use console.time in order to time of the program running

Thanks 
For reviewing my work :-)
